Let's work together to create a block called `CallToAction`.

## Generate the block with Riff ðŸŽ¸

**Rockin' Blocks** comes with `riff`, an early version of our CLI tool, to quickly generate a block. From the root of our workspace, we can run this basic command to quickly generate a working block:

```bash
# Run the command from the root of the workspace
# The block will be generated within blocks/src/components/Blocks

$ yarn riff --name=CallToAction
```

You should see the following success message:

```
ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¶ðŸ¤˜ Successfully created CallToAction! ðŸ¤˜ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¸
Check your blocks/src/components/Blocks directory for you new block!
```
