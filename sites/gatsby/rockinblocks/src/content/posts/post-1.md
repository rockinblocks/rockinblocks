## A frontend-driven Yarn workspace focused on helping developers deliver successful products

There are countless tools and solutions that enable teams to be more productive, but not all tools help teams produce better quality work. Continually I was seeing companies of all sizes facing the same similar issues: struggling with branding, duplicated work, unmanageable code bases. Usually these companies would fall into one of two categories: they had either outgrown their legacy software and design, stitched together over years and years. While initially creating **Rockin' Blocks**, there were a few things I knew I wanted it to do, knowing that there would be potentially some serious ground to cover.

I wanted **Rockin' Blocks** to:

- Easily help developers write documentation as they build their products
- Enable frontend teams to create design systems and beautifully branded sites
- Provide an easy-to-use Yarn workspace and monorepo driven by the JS community
- Give developers a way to delegate work to non-developers earlier in the product lifespan

### How did this come about?

I decided to create an open source project called Rockin' Blocks. I joined the Gatsby Discord and posted in their `#theme-authoring` channel that I had an idea about a project using Gatsby and Tina CMS. A few days later, I chatted about the idea with a key member of the Gatsby team, and they thought the concept was pretty cool, too. We chatted a few times, bouncing ideas back and forth, and feel I have really nailed down a pretty useful tool that can help folks build better projects.

### Always open source

**Rockin' Blocks** will always be open source. Just like WordPress, Vue, Laravel, React, jQuery, and many other tools that I have used over the years, I aim to provide something useful to the community that will and always will remain free to use.

To everyone around the world: Welcome to **Rockin' Blocks**!

Here is to the first of many! Cheers!
