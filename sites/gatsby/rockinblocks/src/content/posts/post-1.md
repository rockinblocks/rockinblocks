## A Gatsby Yarn workspace focused on helping developers deliver successful products and get to MVP faster

### Solving common product problems with a design system starter kit

After nearly a decade doing web development, I began seeing patterns emerge related to the problems start-ups face related to their web presence. Companies of all shapes and sizes, whether a tech start-up destined for Silicon Valley after a meteoric rise, or a small mom-and-pop coffee roaster wanting to leave their imprint on their hometown, suffer from the same problems:

- Inconsistent or nonexistent branding
- A small budget without a moment to spare
- Legacy code, frameworks, and content management systems
- Difficulty creating and managing new content
- No understanding of SEO best practices or web standards

### Solving the root of these problems

While initially creating **Rockin' Blocks**, there were a few things I knew I needed it to do, knowing that there would be potentially some serious ground to cover.

I wanted to help startups get to an MVP as quickly as possible, and I needed **Rockin' Blocks** to:

- Easily help developers write documentation as they build their products
- Provide an easy-to-use Yarn workspace and monorepo driven by the JS community
- Enable frontend teams to craft design systems and beautifully branded sites
- Give developers a way to delegate work to non-developers earlier in the product lifespan
- Always remain open source for the lifecycle of the project, no matter what

### Easily write documentation

**Rockin' Blocks** comes equipped with Markdown support and code highlighting with PrismJS out of the box. This means as soon as you start a new project, you can start writing coherent documentation from day one.

### Crafting elegant design systems



### Always remain open source for the lifecycle of the project

**Rockin' Blocks** will always be open source. Just like WordPress, Vue, Laravel, React, jQuery, and many other tools that I have used over the years, I aim to provide something useful to the community that will and always will remain free to use.

To everyone around the world: Welcome to **Rockin' Blocks**!

Here is to the first of many! Cheers!
