## Our first tour has begun!

After years and years, mentor after mentor, several failed startups, a few easy gigs, countless "impossible" tasks somehow accomplished, amazing clients, problematic clients, WordPress, Gatsby, Drupal, Laravel, Electron, Symfony, Vue....you name it....all of these helped me grow and grow, and I owe so much to Denver and this development community.

### How did this come about?

Over the past year I realized: "Damn.......I have never really paid it back to the open source community." My entire life and much that I have now I owe to open source developers that have busted ass to maintain the tools that put food on my table. Long story short, I decided to create an open source project called Rockin' Blocks. I joined the Gatsby Discord and posted in their `#theme-authoring` channel that I had an idea about a project using Gatsby and Tina CMS. A few days later I chatted about the idea with a key member of the Gatsby team, and they thought the concept was pretty exciting, too. I chatted with them a few times, bouncing ideas back and forth, and feel I have really nailed down a pretty cool idea that I feel would be useful and help folks build better projects.

### What does it do?

**Rockin' Blocks allows you to build, maintain, and ship a reusable block library, as well as  build, maintain, and ship the sites that are built with this library.** A great example might be: Disney has 150 landing pages. A single block library, complete with Disney branding, can be shipped throughout all 150 sites.

### Is Rockin' Blocks for me?

**Rockin' Blocks is:**

- A simple Yarn workspace. It is a great Yarn workspace for beginners and getting used to managing mutiple projects in one monorepo.
- A great starter for a design system. It ships with Storybook so developers can develop components in isolation.
- A great starter for documentation. It ships with Markdown support with code highlighting powered by PrismJS to make writing docs a breeze.

Here is to the first of many! Cheers!
