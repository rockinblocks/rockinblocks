I felt like it was important to have an official mission statement out there that I can reference to make sure I am on track.

## Our Mission Statement

**The mission of Rockin' Blocks is to enable developers to craft and maintain a reusable modular block library and the web applications that use these libraries.**

Blocks conceptually are more primitive than the frameworks or languages that create them. I wanted to be sure that I can always adjust to any changes in the technological landscape over the next few years, while maintaining a clear understanding of the goal I am trying to accomplish.
