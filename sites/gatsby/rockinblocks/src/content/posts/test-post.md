## ðŸŽ¶ If we could just hold hands ðŸŽ¶
```
Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe
```
