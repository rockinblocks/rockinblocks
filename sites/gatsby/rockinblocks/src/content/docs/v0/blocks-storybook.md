## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is a great way for front end developers to get started quickly. The **Rockin' Blocks** monorepo comes with Storybook as a dependency for your blocks library.

### Start Storybook

Storybook can be started from the workspace root, or from the `blocks` directory, as well. Storybook will start at `http://localhost:6006`.

```bash
# From the workspace root
$ yarn blocks:sb

# From the /blocks directory
$ yarn storybook
```
