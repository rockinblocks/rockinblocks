- A monorepo boilerplate for managing both a reuseable block library and sites that utilize the library, all powered by Gatsby and React
- A starter kit for building React libraries from design systems created in Figma and Sketch
- A foundation for writing documentation for your company or application
- A working, easy-to-setup Typescript implementation for building or tinkering with Typescript in React
