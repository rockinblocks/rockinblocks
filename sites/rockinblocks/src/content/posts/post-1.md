## Our first tour has begun!

After years and years, mentor after mentor, failed startups, easy gigs, countless "impossible" tasks accomplished, amazing clients, problematic clients, WordPress, Gatsby, Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, Vue....you name it....all of these helped me grow and grow, and I owe so much to Denver and this development community.

### How did this come about?

Over the past year I realized: "Damn.......I have never really paid it back to the open source community." Literally my entire life and everything I have now I owe to open source developers that have busted ass to maintain the tools that put food on my table and pay for my car.
Long story short, I decided to create an open source project called Rockin' Blocks. I joined the Gatsby Discord and posted in their `#theme-authoring` channel that I had an idea about a project using Gatsby and Tina CMS. I was pretty startled when Kyle Mathews, the creator of Gatsby responded and wanted to set up a call. A few days later we chatted about the idea and he thought the concept was pretty exciting, too. I chatted with him a few times, bouncing ideas back and forth, and feel I have really nailed down a pretty cool idea that I feel would be useful and help folks build better projects.

### What does it do?

**Rockin' Blocks allows you to build, maintain, and ship a reusable block library, as well as  build, maintain, and ship the Gatsby sites that are built with this library.** A great example might be: Disney has 150 landing pages. A single block library, complete with Disney branding, can be shipped throughout all 150 sites.

### Is Rockin' Blocks for me?

**Rockin' Blocks is:**

- A simple Yarn workspace. It is a great Yarn workspace for beginners and getting used to managing mutiple projects in one monorepo.
- A great starter for a design system. It ships with Storybook so developers can develop components in isolation.
- A great starter for documentation. It ships with Markdown support with code highlighting powered by PrismJS to make writing docs a breeze.

Here is to the first of many! Cheers!
