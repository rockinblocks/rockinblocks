## Trying something new should be easy. GatsbyJS nails it.

This morning I became hell-bent on starting some sort of development project. The kicker, however, is that I not only wanted to start a new project today, I wanted to finish it today, as well. I really needed a new blog that allowed me to write more generally about web development, but I didn't want to use Medium or WordPress -- I really wanted to use Javascript, and I really wanted to host it myself. I kept hearing about the simplicity and ease-of-use of [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) through some friends and colleagues, and decided to give it a shot.
